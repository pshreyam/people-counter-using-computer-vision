# People Counter using Computer Vision

This is a simple project that uses computer vision in order to count people inside an area by counting the number of people entering and exiting an area.

## Get Started

To get started, install `python3` or `python` (based on your operating system along with `pip3` or `pip`) and then run the following commands:

```bash
# For Linux/Mac
pip3 install venv
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```

```bash
# For Windows
pip install venv
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

`Note`: If dlib does not get installed using the above dependency, a sample wheel file is given for python3.10. Depending upon the python version, dlib may be needed to be installed using the compatible wheel file.
